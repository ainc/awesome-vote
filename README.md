AwesomeVote is a web service to live poll an audience. It is accompianed by a mobile app. This project is based on MeanJS (Mongo, Express, Angular, NodeJS). 

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
  * Node v5 IS NOT SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME! 
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Ruby - [Download & Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:

## How to Run
* Install all the prerequisites and ensure MongoDB is running.
* Clone the repo or download the zip file. 
* Open up terminal or command prompt and go to the directory you downloaded the repo to.
* Run: ```$ npm install```
* If everything installs successfully, run ```$ grunt```
* If grunt launches successfully, navigate to 'localhost:3000' in your browser.
